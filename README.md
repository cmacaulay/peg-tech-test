# [Peg.co](http://www.peg.co) - Tech Test

## Basic Overview

This basic program is written in ruby and reads a JSON file of [Zoella's](https://peg.co/profiles/zoella280390) last 12 videos, simulating the data analysis that Peg does on a daily basis.

This program prints the following data to your terminal, when run from the command line:
- The title of the video with the highest percentage of likes vs. dislikes
- The average (mean) percentage of likes vs. dislikes for the 12 videos
- The total number of views for all 12 videos
- The average (mean) time interval between Zoella's last 12 videos, in milliseconds
